# Neural networks and deep learning
This repository contains exercises from Neural networks and deep learning course at AGH UST. 
Notebooks present various types of neural networks and different learning algorithms. The aim of the exercises is to understand and compare different machine learning techniques.

## Main topics
- feed forward neural networks,
- dimensionality reduction using PCA and T-SNE,
- Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Contrastive Divergence algorithm,
- Persistent Contrastive Divergence algorithm,
- Deep Belief Networks,
- backpropagation algorithm,
- regularization using L1, L2 norms and dropout,
- ReLu activation function,
- autoencoders
